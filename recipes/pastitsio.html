    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pastitsio is a traditional Greek baked pasta dish, often referred to as Greek lasagna. It features layers of
        pasta, a hearty meat sauce, and a creamy béchamel sauce, making it a rich and comforting meal. To prepare
        pastitsio, start by cooking tubular pasta, such as penne or bucatini, which forms the base layer. The middle
        layer consists of a flavorful meat sauce made from ground beef or lamb, cooked with onions, garlic, tomatoes,
        and spices like cinnamon and allspice, giving it a signature Mediterranean warmth. Finally, a velvety béchamel
        sauce tops the dish, adding a smooth and creamy finish.</p>
    <p>Once assembled, the pastitsio is baked until the top is golden brown and bubbling. The contrast between the crisp
        top layer and the soft pasta and meat filling makes each bite delightful. It's perfect as a main course for
        family gatherings or a special occasion, often served with a fresh Greek salad on the side.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb tubular pasta (penne, bucatini, or ziti)</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef or lamb</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup red wine (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan or kefalotyri cheese</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Béchamel Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups whole milk, warmed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan or kefalotyri cheese</li>
        <li>Pinch of ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the pasta in salted water until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the onion and garlic until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the ground meat and cook until browned. Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine (if using),
            cinnamon, and allspice. Season with salt and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for 20 minutes, allowing the
            flavors to blend. Set aside.</li>
        <li>For the béchamel sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2-3
            minutes to form a roux.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the warmed milk while whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Continue to whisk until the sauce
            thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, and slowly whisk in the beaten eggs. Stir in the cheese, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a greased baking dish, layer half of the cooked pasta. Spread the meat sauce evenly over the pasta, then
            top with the remaining pasta.</li>
        <li>Pour the béchamel sauce over the top layer of pasta, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle with extra grated cheese
            if desired.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Let the pastitsio cool slightly before serving. Cut into squares and enjoy with a side salad.</li>
    </ol>
