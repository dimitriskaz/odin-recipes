    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>A traditional Greek salad, known as <em> Horiatiki</em>
        is a simple yet flavorful dish that showcases the f
        reshness of <b> Mediterranean </b> ingredients.
        To prepare this classic salad, start
        by cutting ripe tomatoes into wedges and
        slicing cucumbers into half-moons.
        Add thin slices of red onion and crisp green
        bell peppers for extra crunch.
        Then, include a handful of Kalamata olives,
        which bring a rich, briny flavor.
        The salad is typically topped with a generous block of
        feta cheese, rather than crumbled,
        giving it a signature Greek touch.</p>

    <p>
        Season the salad with dried oregano, sea salt,
        and a drizzle of high-quality extra virgin olive oil.
        For a bit of tang, add a splash of red wine vinegar.
        The salad is traditionally served without lettuce,
        allowing the bold flavors of the vegetables
        and cheese to shine. It's best enjoyed fresh,
        either on its own or as a side dish, alongside
        crusty bread to soak up the delicious juices.
