    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spanakopita is a classic Greek dish featuring a savory filling of <b>spinach</b> and <b>feta</b> cheese encased
        in crispy
        layers of phyllo pastry. This delightful pie combines the earthy flavor of spinach with the tanginess of feta
        cheese, creating a dish that's both rich and satisfying. To make spanakopita, begin by sautéing fresh spinach
        with onions and garlic until wilted and fragrant. Then, mix in crumbled feta cheese and season with dill and
        nutmeg for added depth of flavor. The filling is then layered between sheets of buttered phyllo pastry, which
        become golden and flaky as they bake.</p>
    <p>Spanakopita is perfect as a main course or a flavorful appetizer. It's best enjoyed warm, straight from the oven,
        but it also makes a tasty snack at room temperature. Serve it with a side of Greek yogurt or a fresh salad for a
        complete meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package phyllo dough (16 oz), thawed</li>
        <li>1 lb fresh spinach, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh dill</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, sauté the onion and garlic in a bit of olive oil until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped spinach and cook until wilted and any excess moisture has evaporated. Season with salt and
            pepper.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Stir in the crumbled feta cheese, beaten eggs, dill, and nutmeg.
        </li>
        <li>Brush a baking dish with melted butter. Lay a sheet of phyllo dough in the dish, brushing it with butter.
            Repeat with 5-6 more sheets, layering them on top of each other.</li>
        <li>Spread the spinach and feta mixture evenly over the phyllo dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the filling with additional sheets of phyllo, brushing each sheet with melted butter. Use about 6-8
            sheets, brushing each with butter before adding the next.</li>
        <li>Trim any overhanging phyllo and tuck the edges into the dish. Brush the top with more melted butter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the phyllo is golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>Let cool slightly before cutting into squares. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
